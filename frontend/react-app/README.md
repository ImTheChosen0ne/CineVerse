This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Your React App will live here.  You will need to run `npm install` to install all your dependencies before starting up the application. While in development, run this application from this location using `npm start`.

Environment variables are needed to run this application in development are NODE_ENV='development' and REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000. Be sure to set the REACT_APP_BASE_URL environment variable when you deploy!

This app will be automatically built when you push to your main branch on Github.
